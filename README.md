## Project Overview

A Distributed Database Management System (DDBMS) designed to support multi-user access, process SQL queries, and maintain ACID compliance across distributed databases. This system provides logging, concurrency control, and a Global Data Dictionary to streamline query execution and data management.

## Features

**Multi-User Support:** Handles multiple users and concurrent requests.

**SQL Query Parsing & Execution:** Accepts and processes SQL queries across distributed databases.

**Logging:** Generates logs with details on user queries, execution times, and crash reports.

**Global Data Dictionary:** Maps data locations and metadata for distributed data management.

**Table Dumps:** Generates table backups for disaster recovery.

**Concurrency & ACID Compliance:** Ensures transaction integrity and consistency.

**ERD Generation:** Creates Entity-Relationship Diagrams based on table relationships.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository.
- Set up the database instances and configure connection settings.
- Run the main application script to start the DDBMS.
- Access logs, tables, and ERDs as needed.

## Usage

- Submit SQL queries to the system for parsing and execution.
- View logs for query details and error reports.
- Use the Global Data Dictionary to check data distribution.
- Generate table dumps and ERDs as needed.
